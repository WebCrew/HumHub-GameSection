# INFORMATION

This repo is not a HumHub Module! It is a tutorial with the needed files to integrate a game section or a simple portfolio into your HumHub installation.

***

**NOTE: I will no longer make use of HumHub and I stop updating my modules and themes for HumHub. It is up to you, you are welcome to update the modules and themes in the future.**

## Extra Note

You can use the repo also to do a portfolio. Just replace the images of the repo, texts and links in the index.html with the ones you want to use.
To edit the text of the "->play now" button, you have to open the grid.js line 347 and rename it to your needs.
